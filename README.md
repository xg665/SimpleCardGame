# SimpleCardGame

###
This is a simple card game that practices Dependency Injection and Loose Coupling between classes. Compile with "javac Solution.java" and run with "java Solution" on the cmd line. A simple deck of card consists of 52 distinct cards ranked by their face values, i.e TWO,THREE,..,ACE. Dealer gives each of two players a hand of five cards during each round. A hand with the highest rank wins that round. To continue playing the same deck, Enter "Y" on the cmd line. The game ends when there is not enough cards to deal two hands

###
